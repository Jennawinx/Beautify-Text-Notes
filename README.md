# Beautify Text Notes

Beautifies naturally written text notes to an html webpage you can take anywhere. 

## Status

This **project has is abandoned** for now due to inefficient design choices (made this in 2 days for fun)
Thinking of remaking a version 2 in the future :)

Problems and needs for improvements
* the syntax definition are not regular enough and require too much pre and post processing
* should not be using regex for parsing
* takes too many intermediate stages to produce the results
* the html results are not semantic
* too slow

## Try it out

Download and run the jar in any folder with your text notes in the .mdc extension. All files in the folder will be converted and combined into 1 beautified html page

### Settings

You can configure settings by creating a file named "./settings.mdcs" next to the jar
Examples of configurable settings are [here](./settings.mdcs)

### Syntax

## Example
