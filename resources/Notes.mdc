Notes
    * No formating should be applied to lead level text
    * Inline commments are applicable everywhere
    * Empty lines are respected
    * Indentation are respected
    * Hanging tab alignment will understand how to resolve text wrapping
      with the previous structure
    * no structures allowed in unlined-table or table
    * all wrappers have to be on a new line

    * Nodes can hold structures
    * Leafs cannot hold stuctures

Types of format structures

    Recursively Nestable Nodes
        body-group
        list                                "*" "o" "-"     bulleted, numbered
        heading                             "====s===="
        subheading                          "----s----"
        divider                             "----"

    Non-Resursive Node structures
        block-comment                       "*/" "\*"       can have structure in comment block

    Leaf structures
        plaintext                           "~~~" wrappers
        inline-code                         ">>>" 
        block-code                          "```" wrappers
        local-link                          images, lcoal files on the computer

        *table                              <- lined table TODO, define an easy to parse format

    Endline decorators
        inline-comment                      "//" "#" "<-"
